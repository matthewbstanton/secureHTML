  <a href="Audio/TOC-01.mp3" target="audioPlayer"  class="audio">T</a>his is a course in 
  assembly language programming of 
  the MIPS processor. 
  It emphasizes the topics needed for study 
  of computer architecture: 
  bits, bit patterns, 
  operations on bit patterns, 
  and how bit patterns represent
  instructions and data.
  This course is equivalent to a semester-long 
  junior college or university course 
  (except, perhaps, for the emphasis on bit patterns).
<p>

<p align="justify">
  The emphasis of the course is on
  understanding how computers work.
  This
  will provide a basis for further
  study of computer architecture
  and computer software.
  The MIPS processor,
  the subject of this course,
  has a well designed architecture
  and is particularly fruitful to study.
  However, the goal of the course is not to turn you into
  a MIPS programmer, but to
  give you an understanding
  of all computer systems.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The only equipment you need for this course is a PC.
  The only software you need is the 
  SPIM simulator of the MIPS32 processor
  and a text editor.
  The simulator is available by free download
  (see  appendix A).
  Example programs are presented
  using an MS Windows
  operating system.
  However, you can use any
  platform that runs SPIM.
  (There are many).

<a href="Audio/TOC-02.mp3" target="audioPlayer" class="audio">A</a>ssembly Language is normally taken
the semester after a course in a high level programming
language (such as Java or C).
This course assumes that you have this background
although no specific programming language is required.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Read the pages of this course <em>actively</em>.
Think about and answer the question at
the bottom of each page.
(This style of tutorial is called <em>programmed learning</em>.
It is very effective for technical material).
Most questions call for
just a little thought.
Some call for pencil and paper.
Keep a pencil and a scrap of paper   next to your keyboard.
Each chapter is about 15 pages long.
Spend several minutes per page.
You can read each chapter in about 30 minutes.
However, for maximum benefit, you should run some of the 
example programs, 
write some programs of your own, 
and then think about
your results.
This may take several hours.
